Portfolio Project

This project showcases what I have learned in regard to animation using css, html and javascript. 

**Pac-Men:** This exercise initiates a game ("start game") wherein the user may add as many pac men as desired. The Pac men will travel at random speeds, and includes edge detection causing each to travel in the opposite direction once arriving at the edge of the screen.

Future iterations of Pac-Men: I would like to include options to end the game and reset/clear. I'd also like to look at having the Pac-Men change colors.

**Eye Movement:** This exercise displays eyes on the screen, and the eyeballs follow the user's mouse as it moves on the screen. 

Future iterations of Eye Movement: I would like to add texture to the background and more details to the creature.

**Real-Time Bus Tracker:** This exercise accesses real time information from a transit system in the Boston area. User can track buses along the stops from Harvard to MIT.

Future iterations of Bus Tracker: I'd like to perform a similar exercise local to me, using San Diego's MTS API.
